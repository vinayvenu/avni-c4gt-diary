## Progress

### Week 1 (11/6/2024 - 17/6/2024)

A working API for Metabase was built in the week before this.<br>
But the code did not follow good coding practises.<br>
For example the famous DRY principle was being violated.<br>
So this week was basically about refactoring the code so that it adheres to the benchmarks of a good code base!

#### New moves learnt
- DRY
- Code Smell
- Primitive Obsession
- Generic Method

#### Challenges, victories and defeats
- Commit [link](https://github.com/avniproject/avni-server/pull/734/commits/6f304c46fcabc12a38338c85bd1912f5eca3981b)
- Still some code smell and primitive obsesion is left to be removed which will be removed in Week2!
