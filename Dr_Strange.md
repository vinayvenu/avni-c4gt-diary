# Dr. Strange

## Quest
- Enhance Developer Friendliness for Avni

## Milestones
- Set up the project on my local device.
- Replicate the issue: Add the ability to identify the location of the form input on the concepts page ([Issue #1116](https://github.com/avniproject/avni-webapp/issues/1116)).
- Determine and implement the best approach to resolve this issue.
- Submit a pull request with the solution by tomorrow.

## Progress

### Week 1 (11/6/2024 - 17/6/2024)
#### New Skills Acquired
-  exploration of the AvniWebApp codebases.
- Code optimization techniques and code quality improvements.
- Gained a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
- Learning Spring Boot.
- Reinforced React concepts.

#### Challenges, Achievements, and Learnings
- Initially faced difficulties working in a large codebase, but steadily becoming more familiar with it.
- Successfully replicated and identified form input issues on the concepts page.
- Nearly resolved [Issue #1116](https://github.com/avniproject/avni-webapp/issues/1116). The remaining work will be completed by tomorrow, and I will submit my first pull request 18jun.

### Week 2 (18/6/2024 - 24/6/2024)

#### New Skills Acquired
- Learned about Material-UI and React Admin.
- Studied code smell and its implications.
- Reinforced foundational React concepts.

#### Challenges, Victories, and Defeats
- Faced an issue in the "used in form" section of the Avni webapp where multiple forms appeared, even those not intended for that section. Debugging this took time, and there was also a need to redesign the "used in form" section to ensure consistency with other sections. This delay caused a postponement in PR submission, but the issue is now resolved, and I will submit the PR by today.
